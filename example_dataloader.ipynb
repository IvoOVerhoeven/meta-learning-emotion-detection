Funny how [NAME] may wants to amend GFA the next day\n4 Hmm. I don't disagree. It's unfortunate.\n5 Wish you the best of luck and greener pastures!\n12 What a cringeworthy load of kak this is.

Enjoy.\n18 I love Florida\n13 [NAME] and [NAME] are the only reason to tune in at this point. Happy birthday!\n10 Nope, not my department.\n9 I feel like this happens to me every single time I shop there. I dont go in anymore because I'm tired of being followed.\n24 My whole life’s been a lie\n11 That looks disgusting.\n23 yes and I'm glad that this nonsense stops with me\n21 Wow OP sounds like you're really skilled at opening your legs, you're parents should be proud of you, STI and all.\n19 Im always worrying about the same thing, thats why Im always posting and within hours freaking out and deleting my posts \n\n"
